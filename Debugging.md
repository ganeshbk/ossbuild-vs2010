# Debug symbols #
The debug symbols are not included in the distribution packages, because without the source code they wouldn't be very useful anyway. Just follow [build instructions](Building.md) to compile, and the `.pdb` files will be generated in `Build\Windows\Win32\Release\pdb`.

# Debug log #
Debug log is generated by setting two environment variables:

  * `GST_DEBUG=*:3`  (For example, INFO level for all debug categories.)
  * `GST_DEBUG_FILE=GstreamerLog.txt`  (File to write to.)
