# Introduction #

GStreamer includes a functionality to save pipeline graphs to a GraphViz `.dot` file. To view these files, they must first be rendered to `.png`.

First of all, you need to install [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php). After that, you need a `.dot` file to test. One is generated by e.g. [[the C# example](CSharpGettingStarted.md)].

Then just shift-rightclick on `graph.dot` and click "Open with..". Select the [view\_graph.bat](http://code.google.com/p/ossbuild-vs2010/source/browse/Examples/view_graph.bat) as the program and click OK.

# Details #

The pipeline saves are enabled only if environment variable `GST_DEBUG_DUMP_DOT_DIR` is set to a directory.

The command-line `gst-launch` tool automatically saves graphs on every state transition.

The stock gstreamer-sharp doesn't have an interface for easily saving the graphs. I have [added](http://code.google.com/p/ossbuild-vs2010/source/diff?spec=svn85f9aa4749d687a49a5629294f95e0b3b41aa96b&r=85f9aa4749d687a49a5629294f95e0b3b41aa96b&format=side&path=/Main/GStreamer/Source/gstreamer-sharp/gstreamer-sharp/Bin.custom) an interface to Bins and Pipelines. Simply call `my_pipeline.DebugToDotFile("graph")`.
